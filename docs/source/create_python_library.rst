Creating a Python Library (for :code:`ament_python`)
====================================================

Let us start, as already recommended in this tutorial, with a template by :program:`ros2 pkg create`.

.. code:: bash

   cd ~/ros2_tutorial_workspace
   ros2 pkg create python_package_with_a_library --build-type ament_python --library-name sample_python_library
   
which outputs the forever beautiful wall of text we're by now used to, with a minor difference regarding the additional library template

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 25, 26

   going to create a new package
   package name: python_package_with_a_library

Overview of the library
-----------------------

.. note::

   If you have created the bad habit of declaring all/too many things in your :file:`__init__.py` file, take the hint and start breaking the definitions into different files and use the :file:`__init__.py` just to export the relevant parts of your library. 

For the sake of the example, let us create a library with a Python :code:`function` and another one with a :code:`class`.

To guide our next steps, we first draw a quick overview of what our :code:`python_package_with_a_library` will look like.

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5,6
   
   python_package_with_a_library
      └── python_package_with_a_library
         └── sample_python_library
            __init__.py
            _sample_class.py
            _sample_function.py
         __init__.py
      └── resource
      └── test
      
With respect to the highlighted files, we will

#. Create the :code:`_sample_function.py`.
#. Create the :code:`_sample_class.py`.
#. Modify :file:`__init__.py` to use the new :code:`function` and :code:`class`.      
      
All other files and directories will remain as-is, in the way they were generated by :program:`ros2 pkg create`.      
      
Create the sample :code:`function`
----------------------------------

Add a new file to :file:`python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library` called :file:`_sample_function.py` with the following content.

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_function.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 26-

The function has two parameters, :code:`a` and :code:`b`. For simplicity, we're expecting arguments of type :code:`float` and returning a :code:`float`, but it could be any Python function.

Create the sample :code:`class`
-------------------------------

Add a new file to :file:`python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library` called :file:`_sample_class.py` with the following content.

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/_sample_class.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 26-
   
The class is quite simple with a `private data member <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables>`_ and a method to retrieve it.
   
Modify the :code:`__init__.py` to export the symbols
----------------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../ros2_tutorial_workspace/src/python_package_with_a_library/python_package_with_a_library/sample_python_library/__init__.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 24-
