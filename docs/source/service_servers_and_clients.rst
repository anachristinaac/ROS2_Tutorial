At your Service: Servers and Clients
====================================

.. note::

   Except for the particulars of the :file:`setup.py` file, the way that services in ROS2 work in Python, i.e. the explanation in this section, does not depend on :program:`ament_python` or :program:`ament_cmake`.


In some cases, we need means of communication in which each command has an associated response. That is where :code:`Services` come into play.

Create the package
------------------

We start by creating a package to use the :code:`Service` we first created in :ref:`Services`.

.. code-block:: console

    cd ~/ros2_tutorial_workspace/src
    ros2 pkg create python_package_that_uses_the_services \
    --build-type ament_python \
    --dependencies rclpy package_with_interfaces

Overview
--------

Before we start exploring the elements of the package, let us

#. Create the Node with a Service Server.
#. Create the Node with a Service Client.
#. Update the :file:`setup.py` so that :program:`ros2 run` finds these programs.
