Editing Python source (with :code:`PyCharm`)
============================================

There are near infinite ways to manage your :code:`Python` code and, for this tutorial, we will use :code:`PyCharm`. Namely, the free community version.

Installing :code:`PyCharm`
--------------------------

:code:`PyCharm` is a great program for managing one's :code:`Python` sources that is frequently updated and has a free edition. However, precisely because it is frequently updated, there is no way for this tutorial to keep track of future changes.

What we will do, instead, is to download an specific :code:`PyCharm` version for these tutorials, so that it is predictable. If you'd prefer using the shiniest new version, be sure to wear sunglasses and to not stare directly into the light.

Run

.. code:: bash

   cd ~/ros2_workspace
   wget https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2023.1.1.tar.gz
